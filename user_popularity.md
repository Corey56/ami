To gain an outlook on how leaders in the corps might interact with the Cadet AMI web application, we had 2 platoon sergeants and a squad leader interact with the app and answer a few questions. The information that we found is intriguing!

## Participants (2 subjects):
- 1 Platoon Sergeant
	- Sub1
- 1 Squad Leader    
	- Sub3


## Feedback:
### Do you believe this application is useful?
Sub3: Yes!
Sub1: Yes, i do.

### Do the benefits outweigh the negatives, if any?
Sub3: The Learning curve is pretty light, and it’s a powerful app; but AMI isn’t really taken that seriously, so it’s implementation would require some culture change.
Sub1: Getting people to actually care about ami would be necessary to make it effective, but if leadership cares then the benefits would outweigh the negatives.

### Is the layout clear and concise?
Sub3: Yes!
Sub1: Yeah, I like the layout.

### On a scale of 1-10, 10 being impossible and 1 being too easy, how hard was it to find the information you needed?

Sub1: 2

### Did you experience any issues with the application?
Sub3: The menu button doesn’t work in Portrait mode on mobile devices. [**FIXED**]
Sub1: I don't think so.
